## Introduction 🚀

Welcome to the Akash AutoDeployer tool! This powerful tool simplifies the process of deploying your applications to the Akash Network, a decentralized cloud platform built on blockchain technology. Whether you're a developer, a business owner, or a blockchain enthusiast, this tool provides an intuitive interface to manage your cloud deployments effortlessly.

## What is Akash Network? 🌐

[Akash Network](https://akash.network/) is a decentralized cloud marketplace that enables developers and businesses to access and provide cloud computing resources. It leverages blockchain technology to offer secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud services.

## Features 🌟

- **Streamlined Deployment:** Deploy your applications on Akash with just a few clicks.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design makes cloud deployment accessible to everyone.
- **Customization:** Configure your deployments to match your specific requirements.
- **Security:** Built-in security measures ensure the safety of your applications.
- **Cost Control:** Monitor and manage your cloud expenses effectively.

## Getting Started 🛠️

Instead of replicating the runtime on your local machine, we recommend you to directly use the <b>Akash Ecofuse Autodeployer</b> available here:
[Live Auto Deployer Demo](http://34.131.239.28/Auto_deployer)

However, if you prefer running your own local runtime and experimenting with it, here is a detailed guide below!

### Prerequisites 📦

Before using the Akash AutoDeployer tool on your local machine, make sure you have the following:

- A valid Akash Network account and wallet.
- Docker installed on your system.
- A GitHub repository for your project.
- Python compiler installed (duhh)

## Packages required 📜

- langchain >=0.0.271
- streamlit >=1.27.0
- chromadb >=0.4.13
- openai >=0.27.9

  other native imports: requests, os, subprocess.

### Installation 🚚

To install the Akash AutoDeployer tool, follow these steps:

```bash
streamlit run autodeployer.py
```

## Usage 📝

Using the Akash AutoDeployer tool is straightforward and involves three main steps:

### Step 1: Configuration ⚙️

Before deploying your application, you'll need to configure your project settings, including your api keys and model configurations.

```bash
- github api token
- Open Ai api key
- Model type (chatgpt-3.5 , ada, davinci, etc.)
```

### Step 2: Deploy 🚀

Deploy your application by first running the Dockeriser and SDL generator wizard here:

```bash
http://localhost:8501/
http://127.0.0.1:8501/
```
 Once you have your Docker Image and SDL ready, simple head on to [Akash console](https://console.akash.network/landing) or [Cloudmos](https://deploy.cloudmos.io/) to complete the deployment process.
 You can use the "custom SDL" option to directly deploy with the SDL generated by the Autodeployer.

### Step 3: Manage 🧑‍💻

Manage your deployments easily with the following commands:

- `akash-autodeployer list`: List all your active deployments.
- `akash-autodeployer scale`: Scale your deployments up or down.
- `akash-autodeployer close`: Close and terminate a deployment.

## Advanced Options 🔧

Explore advanced options and customizations to tailor your deployments to your exact needs.

## Dockerfile 🐳

A Dockerfile is a script used to create a Docker image. It specifies the application's environment and dependencies. The Akash AutoDeployer tool generates a Dockerfile based on your project's requirements.

## Docker Image 🖼️

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package containing your application and its dependencies. Images can be deployed to the Akash Network.

## Service Description Language (SDL) 📜

The SDL file defines the configuration of your service on the Akash Network. It includes details like the Docker image, resource requirements, and deployment profiles.
